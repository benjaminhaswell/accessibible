## Web Accessibility Overview
Web accessibility ensures that everybody, regardless of ability can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web.

### Five Most Common Accessibility Violations/Examples

> #### 1. Keyboard Functionality
> 
> Many people (probably including you!) rely on keyboard controls (tab, enter, arrow keys, etc.) to navigate the web. When websites aren't keyboard accessible, the many people who rely on keyboards to navigate are completely blocked off from many functionalities and content.

> #### 2. Color Contrast
> 
> Insufficient color contrast between content and their background can make content difficult to read (or generally perceive) for individuals with visual impairments.

> #### 3. Alt Text for Images
> 
> Alternative text (alt text) is read aloud by screen readers and also serve generally as a description of an image's content. When alt text isn't included, people who rely on screen readers are excluded from the contents of the image.

> #### 4. Focus Indicators
> 
> Focus indicators allow keyboard and screen reader users to understand which element is currently being focused.

> #### 5. Form/Info Labels
> 
> Form inputs and other elements have labels which indicate the information needed for that particular field. Many users, particularly screen reader users, rely on these labels to understand the forms and their required information.

These are just five of the _many_ examples when it comes to inaccessible web pages.
